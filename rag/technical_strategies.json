    "category": "Technical Strategy",
    "concept": "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. in 1978. It measures the velocity and magnitude of directional price movements and provides traders with a numerical value between 0 and 100. RSI helps evaluate whether an asset is overbought or oversold, thereby identifying potential reversal points or trend continuations. It is one of the most widely used technical indicators in stock, forex, and cryptocurrency markets.",
    "calculation": "RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS)), where RS (Relative Strength) = Average Gain over n periods / Average Loss over n periods. The default period is 14. Example: If an asset gained an average of $1 over 10 days and lost an average of $0.50, RS = 1 / 0.5 = 2, RSI = 100 - (100 / (1+2)) = 66.7.",
    "parameters": "Default setting is 14 periods, but traders often adjust to 9 for short-term trading or 21 for longer-term analysis. Thresholds are commonly 70 (overbought) and 30 (oversold), though some traders use 80/20 for more extreme signals.",

The bands expand during high volatility and contract during low volatility, helping traders spot breakouts and trend continuations.",
    "calculation": "Upper Band = SMA(n) + (k * Standard Deviation), Lower Band = SMA(n) - (k * Standard Deviation). Typically n = 20, k = 2. Example: If the 20-day SMA is 100 and the standard deviation is 5, the upper band = 100 + (2*5) = 110, lower band = 100 - (2*5) = 90.",
